The following is a collection of every assignment that I completed from CS 418 at UIUC. 
Topics include image transformation, 3-d transformational geometry, perspective, lighting,
animation, parametric surfaces, rasterization, vertex shaders, and much more. 

Interactive Computer Graphics offers an introduction to computer graphics programming, focusing on the techniques needed to support interaction, such as for computer games, virtual environments or other real-time simulations. The course utilizes the "C" programming language and the OpenGL graphics programming library, though students can use a different language and library with the instructor's permission.
