=====

The following is a collection of every assignment that I completed from CS 418 at UIUC. 
Topics include image transformation, 3-d transformational geometry, perspective, lighting,
animation, parametric surfaces, rasterization, vertex shaders, and much more. 

Interactive Computer Graphics offers an introduction to computer graphics programming, focusing on the techniques needed to support interaction, such as for computer games, virtual environments or other real-time simulations. The course utilizes the "C" programming language and the OpenGL graphics programming library, though students can use a different language and library with the instructor's permission.


This is a repo of my MP submissions from the Fall 2013 semester of UIUC's CS 418 "Computer Graphics".

## To TAs at UIUC

This course is largely based on the creativity of students. Unlike many other courses, the contents of this repository are entirely my own work and the University of Illinois maintains no license on them, implied or otherwise â€“ this is half the reason why I chose to attend UIUC. Additionallity, it is your job as a TA to ensure that students do not cheat by copying code verbatim or without proper attribution.
